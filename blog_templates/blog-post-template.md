## Intro

This file replaces the old HTML blog post template so every blog post can be authored as Markdown.

## Body

Write the post in Markdown and include any needed images with standard syntax:

![Example image](/images/your-image.png)

## Publish checklist

1. Save your note into `blogs/<slug>.md`.
2. Run `node scripts/generate-posts-index.mjs`.
3. Open `/blogs/post.html?post=<slug>` to preview.
