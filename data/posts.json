    "content": "## Public and Untrusted WiFi Networks\n\nPublic WiFi is convenient, but convenience often means reduced trust. Even with HTTPS everywhere, there are still privacy, interception, and misconfiguration risks that can expose users and organizations.\n\n![Public WiFi warning visual](/images/disclaimer.png)\n\n### Common risks on untrusted networks\n\n- **Evil twin access points:** attacker-controlled hotspots that mimic legitimate SSIDs.\n- **Traffic interception attempts:** DNS manipulation, captive portal abuse, and downgrade attempts.\n- **Device exposure:** accidental sharing services and stale local trust settings.\n- **Session hijacking opportunities:** especially with weakly protected web sessions.\n\n### Practical hardening steps (iOS and Android)\n\n1. **Prefer cellular data** for sensitive sessions.\n2. **Use a trusted VPN** when WiFi is unavoidable.\n3. **Disable auto-join** for unknown or open networks.\n4. **Use randomized/private MAC addresses** on every network.\n5. **Enable private DNS / encrypted DNS** where possible.\n6. **Keep OS and apps updated** to reduce exploitability.\n7. **Restrict app permissions** to minimum required access.\n8. **Avoid high-risk actions** (banking, corporate admin portals) on public WiFi.\n9. **Use MFA** for all critical accounts.\n10. **Turn off nearby sharing services** when not needed.\n\n### Defensive operating habits\n\n- Verify the hotspot name with staff before connecting.\n- Treat captive portals as untrusted input.\n- Log out after completing sessions.\n- Restart your device after disconnecting from risky networks.\n\n### Disclaimer\n\nThis material is educational and informational only.

    "content": "## Obsidian Threat Heat Map\n\nHaving a repeatable way to track incidents is critical if you want to derive trends, improve triage, and predict risk over time. This workflow repurposes Obsidian graph features as a lightweight threat relationship map.\n\n> **No real incident data is used in this example.**\n> All data is fake and intentionally defanged.\n\n![A beautiful heatmap in Obsidian](/images/obsidian-heatmap.png)\n\n### 1) Defang your IOCs before anything else\n\nUse CyberChef (or equivalent) to neutralize indicators such as IPs, domains, URLs, and email addresses before storing or sharing.\n\n![Defanging fake IOCs](/images/cyberchef.png)\n\n### 2) Bulk-tag indicators to speed up linking\n\nAfter you prepare a list of IOCs in a text editor, wrap each IOC in Obsidian wiki-link syntax (`[[...]]`). This causes each IOC to become a linked object in the graph.\n\n![Performing mass text manipulation](/images/textmanipulation.png)\n\n### 3) Use a consistent incident template\n\nA consistent template prevents missing fields and keeps your graph meaningful as your data set grows.\n\n![Template incident report](/images/obsidiantemplate.png)\n\n### 4) Build relationships across incidents\n\nLoad your tagged IOCs into multiple incidents. Shared artifacts automatically create graph relationships.\n\n![Tagged and defanged IOCs loaded](/images/taggediocs.png)\n\nAs your case volume grows, linked artifacts make it easier to identify recurring campaigns, repeated targets, and hotspot clusters.\n\n![Observing links in graph view](/images/furtherlinks.png)\n\n### Why this helps\n\n- Visualizes incident overlap over time.\n- Highlights repeated attacker infrastructure.\n- Surfaces frequent target groups/departments.\n- Makes trend communication easier for leadership.\n\n### Closing thoughts\n\nThis is not a replacement for full-scale threat intelligence platforms. It is a practical and low-friction workflow for teams already using Obsidian that want better visibility with minimal overhead.\n",
