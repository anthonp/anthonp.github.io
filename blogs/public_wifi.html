          <h2>Public and Untrusted WiFi Networks</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Risk should neither be ignored nor dismissed. A key part of responsible cybersecurity practice is acknowledging and owning the risks within your purview—while maintaining a balanced, non-alarmist perspective. As cybersecurity professionals, it is important to acknowledge that connecting to public or untrusted WiFi networks introduces risks that can often outweigh the convenience. While personal VPN services can help mitigate exposure on such networks, they should be viewed as part of a layered defense strategy rather than a complete solution.</li>
            <li>Although public networks are sometimes labeled as "safe" or considered to present only a "minimal" risk, they can still enable unauthorized access to data and communication streams. Potential risks include:</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks</li>
            <li>Metadata and Traffic Harvesting</li>
            <li>Rogue Access Points</li>
            <li>Reliance on third-party security hygiene and configurations</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Happens When You Connect to WiFi?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>When connecting to WiFi, your device typically communicates with a Wireless Access Point (WAP), which manages wireless authentication and forwards traffic to the broader internet through a private IP and Network Address Translation (NAT). This facilitates communication for services such as email, mobile apps, and notifications.</li>
            <li>A common counterpoint to WiFi security concerns is that “most websites use HTTPS/TLS encryption.” While this is technically accurate, it does not fully address all risks (see “What about TLS/HTTPS?”).</li>
            <li>It’s also worth noting that during events like DEF CON and Black Hat in 2024, the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department issued a cyber awareness advisory. Their guidance included disabling WiFi and Bluetooth, restarting devices daily, and avoiding contactless payments — highlighting that real-world threats are taken seriously even by law enforcement.</li>
            <li>Should users be cautious when connecting to shared or public networks? Absolutely — but fear shouldn't paralyze. With awareness and appropriate precautions, risk can be managed effectively. Personally, I avoid connecting to public networks when possible. If I must, I apply proper security measures to protect my devices and data.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What About TLS/HTTPS?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Reputable organizations encrypt web services using HTTPS/TLS to protect the integrity and confidentiality of user data. However, certain circumstances can still render these protections ineffective.</li>
            <li>For example, in 2015, the Government of Kazakhstan introduced a national root certificate that, if installed, allowed interception and decryption of HTTPS traffic — a move that raised global concerns among privacy advocates and tech firms.</li>
            <li>End users are sometimes prompted to install Certificate Authority (CA) certificates without a clear understanding of the implications, effectively allowing decryption of what would otherwise be encrypted traffic.</li>
            <li>Installing unknown or untrusted CA certificates is never recommended unless required by policy or law.</li>
            <li>Threat actors can exploit captive portals or rogue access points to prompt users to install malicious CA certificates, enabling interception of TLS traffic. This risk is heightened when the user lacks technical awareness of these mechanisms.</li>
            <li>Even on legitimate public networks, visibility into security controls is limited. Is the network segmented? Are devices monitored? Has the WAP been compromised? Often, these questions remain unanswered, and without internal knowledge, end users cannot fully assess the trustworthiness of the network infrastructure.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What Can Still Be Exposed Without Access to Encrypted Data?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Unencrypted Protocols:</strong> While uncommon in modern systems, legacy protocols such as HTTP, FTP, Telnet, and DNS can still be in use — especially in older infrastructure or by misconfigured systems. These can expose sensitive data in plaintext.</li>
            <li><strong>Metadata and Traffic Patterns:</strong> Even without access to content, actors can gather MAC addresses (if not randomized), analyze destination domains, and infer behavior based on timing and volume of traffic — potentially identifying high-value targets.</li>
            <li><strong>Session Hijacking:</strong> If session tokens or cookies are not transmitted securely, attackers may be able to impersonate users across services by capturing these artifacts.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2>Mobile Device Security Hardening for Untrusted WiFi Networks</h2>
          <p>While not an end-all, be-all set of steps, deploying best practices can mitigate specific risks. You are responsible for your digital hygeine, and this is not an exhaustive list of steps.</p>
